It has been two months since I posted the article.

My life has rapidly changed during last two months.

I could concentrate on the frontend engineering and performance optimization now.

And I'm really good at it.

Back to the XP topic, the immediate customer feedback makes me thrill and excited.

I recall one of guest from the podcast episode said,

Many failed businesses are caused by

1. Not letting the users give feedbacks, but build based on their filtered information.
2. Not provide the users solutions, but hearing their pain points.
3. Postpone the release due to some excuses like 'We cannot launch without this', 'We cannot launch without that'.
   It would lead the product to failure before it launched. And the business owner would miss the chance for correcting the failures.

Well, previously, I am not a business owner but I certainly had a tremendous concern regarding these facts.

It was a good turnaround and the major job turns into controlling the product timeline expectation.

Goodbye, mini water fall. And hello, extreme programming.
